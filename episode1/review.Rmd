Let's check the features and model built from our recent flows.

```{r}
library(metaflow)

f <- flow_client$new("HouseFlow")
print(f$runs)
```

```{r}
r <- run_client$new("HouseFlow/482")
print(r$artifacts)
dt <- r$artifact("features")
head(dt)
fitted.model <- r$artifact("model")
print(fitted.model)
```
